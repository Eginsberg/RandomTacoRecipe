from PIL import Image

# I start by importing the needed libraries

'''image = Image.open('taco.jpg')

width = image.width

height = image.height

print(width, height)

I then use the commented out code to find the proportions of the image to change by a ratio of 7.32 to get the
max size to 800 px'''
